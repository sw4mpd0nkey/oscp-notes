# Google Dorks
Google Dorking, also known as Google Hacking, is a technique used to find sensitive information or confidential data on the Internet by using advanced operators in Google search queries. These special operators make it possible to search for specific types of files or information. These files or information may be login pages, unsecured databases, and sensitive documents. This technique is helpful for many purposes, such as personal research, job applications, or even cybersecurity and penetration testing. With Google Dorking, it is possible to uncover hidden information that is not easily accessible through regular search methods. This technique is a valuable tool for anyone looking to dig deeper into the vast ocean of information on the Internet.

Some of the most common operators used in Google Dorking include:

- “site:” : to search for a specific term on a specific website.
- “filetype:” : to search for specific files, such as PDF or Excel.
- “intext:” : to search for specific text within a website.
- “inurl:” : to search for specific keywords in URLs.
- “define:” : to find the definition of a word or phrase.
- “password site:example.com” : will search for the term “password” on the website “example.com”
- “budget filetype:xls” : will return excel files with the keyword “budget” in them.
- “intext: password filetype: doc” : will return all word files with the keyword “password” in them.
- “inurl: admin” : will return all the URLs that have the keyword “admin” in them.
- “define: google dorking” : will return the definition of the phrase “Google Dorking.”
